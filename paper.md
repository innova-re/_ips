Development of a 3D Model Indoor Navigation System using EcmaScript 6
=======================

Introduction
------------

It is extremely important for students and external people to find their destination such as class rooms, laboratories, libraries in a large complex buildings, such as a university.
Most indoor navigation systems such as Google map use 2D maps to represent the environment.
However, these maps do not provide adequate information to navigate floor plans and view objects.

The aim of this work is to explore the usability of a 3D model for indoor localization and navigation by creating a mobile navigation application for the "Università degli studi di Cagliari", Italy.

A successful implementation of the proposed system would provide visitors of "Università degli studi di Cagliari" with their current locations displayed in a 3D model of the building on their mobile device and the shortest route when searching for a place of interest.

This paper is organized as follows.
In section 2 the detailed implementation of the system is introduced with descriptions of system architecture and graphic user interface.
Finally, the conclusions and recommendations are provided in section 3.


The goal
--------

View and navigate floor plans of the "Università degli studi di Cagliari" within commercial smart-phones.

Challenges
----------

The orientation in the building is complicated by:

 - absence of GPS

 - the existence of multiple levels.

Motivation
----------

Navigate inside huge buildings where indoor navigation is necessity.

State of the art
----------------

The proliferation of mobile devices and the growing demand for location aware systems that filter information based on currently device location have led to an increase in research and product development in this field.

Modern smart-phones have several sensors which are pertinent to the localization problem.
Such sensors can be Wifi, Bluetooth, accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope sensors.

Existing Tools
--------------

- Google Indoor Navigation
- Google Maps Floor Plan Marker

Technology adoption
-------------------

- PhoneGap

- Captures device motion in the x, y, and z direction.

- Radio Signal Strength Indications (RSSI) can be translated into distances from beacon points by means of theoretical or empirical radio propagation models.

Keywords
--------

Pedestrian Navigation, RSS Fingerprinting, Indoor Navigation, Wifi Access Points, Bluetooth stations, Location Patterning (Pattern Recognition) Techniques, Dijkstra’s algorithm
